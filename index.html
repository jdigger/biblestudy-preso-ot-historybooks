<section id="_joshua_themes"><h2>Joshua - Themes</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>The book of Joshua is designed to show God&#8217;s faithfulness to His promises by conquering, possessing, and dividing the Promised Land with its fortified cities.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_joshua_his_names"><h2>Joshua - His Names</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Joshua, the son of Nun, was Moses' servant. His original name was Hoshea (Num. 13:8; Deut. 32:44) which means &#8220;salvation.&#8221; But during the wilderness wanderings Moses changed his name to Yehoshua, meaning &#8220;Yahweh is salvation&#8221; or &#8220;Save, Yahweh&#8221; (Num. 13:16). Joshua is a contracted form of Yehoshua.</p></div></div></section>

For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.</blockquote></div>
<div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+4:14&amp;version=NKJV">Joshua 4:14</a> &#8220;On that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.&#8221;</blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_joshua_some_key_verses_2"><h2>Joshua - Some Key Verses 2</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+11%3A23&amp;version=NKJV">Joshua 11:23</a> So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land rested from war.</blockquote></div>
<div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+24%3A14-15&amp;version=NKJV">Joshua 24:14-15</a> &#8220;Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve the Lord! And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&#8221;</blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_joshua_previews_of_christ_1"><h2>Joshua - Previews of Christ 1</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Though there are no direct Messianic prophecies of Christ, there are a number of types which point to the Savior. Joshua is a type of Christ in two very important ways.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First, his name, Yeshua, a contracted form of Yehoshua, meaning, &#8220;Yahweh is salvation,&#8221; is the Greek equivalent of the name Jesus. Joshua is actually called by the name Jesus in the the Greek-written book of Acts:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7%3A45&amp;version=KJV">Acts 7:45 KJV</a> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_joshua_previews_of_christ_2"><h2>Joshua - Previews of Christ 2</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Second, Joshua is seen as a type of Christ in his work of leading Israel triumphantly into the rest of their promised possession, the land of Canaan (cf. Heb. 4:8). This is but a foretaste of the rest we enter by faith in Christ. He surely foreshadows the Savior who leads &#8220;many sons to glory&#8221; (Heb. 2:9-10). Further, Joshua was met by the Commander of the Lord&#8217;s army in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+5%3A13-15&amp;version=NKJV">5:13-15</a>. This is undoubtedly a Christophany, a preincarnate appearance of Christ.</p></div></div></section>

<section id="_judges_themes_1"><h2>Judges - Themes 1</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>The book of Judges spans 325 years, showing the judgment of God, as well as His forgiveness.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Canaan had been inhabited by evil nations who worshipped many false gods and idols. The Israelites again compromised and allowed the influence of those practices to corrupt them.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_judges_themes_2"><h2>Judges - Themes 2</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>First the judges deliver the people; then they rule and administer justice.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The best known judges are Deborah, Gideon, and Samson.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_judges_purpose_1"><h2>Judges - Purpose 1</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>The contrast between the moods of Joshua and Judges is striking. Israel goes from the thrill of victory to the agony of defeat. From freedom to oppression.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Historically, Judges bridges the gap from the time of Joshua to the time of the prophet Samuel, and the beginning of the monarchy under Saul and David. It records the history of seven cycles of decline, oppression, supplication, and deliverance.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_judges_purpose_2"><h2>Judges - Purpose 2</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>As God had warned in Deuteronomy, obedience brings blessing, but disobedience results in God&#8217;s discipline.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In doing so, it becomes an explanation for why Israel wanted a king, even though they were warned not to.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_judges_key_verses_1"><h2>Judges - Key Verses 1</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+1%3A27-33&amp;version=NKJV">Judges 1:27-33</a> However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants&#8230;&#8203; And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out. Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites&#8230;&#8203; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants&#8230;&#8203; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put under tribute. Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants&#8230;&#8203; So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out. Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants&#8230;&#8203; the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them.</blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_judges_key_verses_2"><h2>Judges - Key Verses 2</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+2%3A20-23&amp;version=NKJV">Judges 2:20-23</a> Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He said, &#8220;Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice, I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died, so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the Lord, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.&#8221; Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_judges_previews_of_christ"><h2>Judges - Previews of Christ</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Since each judge functioned as a ruler-deliverer, they served as pictures of His work as Savior and Lord, the Righteous Deliverer King.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_ruth"><h2>Ruth</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Living In the Shadow of the Judges</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_ruth_themes_1"><h2>Ruth - Themes 1</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Ruth is the story of a couple in Israel who, during a time of famine, moved to Moab. There the husband and his two sons died, leaving the mother (Naomi) alone with her two daughters-in-law (Orpah and Ruth). Naomi decided to move back to Israel, and Ruth insisted on returning with her. Once in Israel, they turned to a relative by the name of Boaz for help. Eventually, Ruth married Boaz.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ruth sparkles against the dark days of the book of Judges. Ruth is the story of loyalty, purity, and love when anarchy, selfishness, and depravity was generally the rule.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_ruth_themes_2"><h2>Ruth - Themes 2</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Ruth also serves as an important link in the ancestry of King David and is found in the line of Messiah (Matt 1:5).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Other purposes of Ruth are seen in the way it illustrates the truths of the Kinsman-Redeemer, the presence of a godly remnant even in times of great apostasy, and God&#8217;s faithfulness to those who will walk with Him by faith. Since Ruth was a Gentile, the book illustrates God&#8217;s desire to bring the Gentile world into the family of God.</p></div></div></section>
